# Queen's BioMechatronics Team (QBMeT) Exoskeleton Project

Welcome to the Queen's BioMechatronics Team (QBMeT) Exoskeleton Project repository!

## About Us

Queenâ€™s BioMechatronics Team (QBMeT) is dedicated to designing and constructing load-bearing leg exoskeletons for real-world applications. Our design aims to reduce mechanical load and assist in agility for firefighters.
Project Overview

This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources related to the development of our exoskeleton suit. The suit is designed to assist firefighters by reducing physical strain and enhancing agility during operations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. docs

- Description: Contains all hardware specification sheets and suit documentation.
- Contents: Datasheets, user manuals, design documents, and other technical documentation related to the exoskeleton suit.

### 2. testing-hardware

- Description: Contains code for testing individual hardware components, such as motors and sensors.
- Contents: Test scripts, setup instructions, and results for each hardware component.

### 3. suit-code

- Description: The main codebase deployed onto the suit for control and feedback.
- Contents: Control algorithms, feedback systems, integration code, and deployment scripts.

### 4. algorithm-dev

- Description: Development area for algorithms that will later be deployed on the suit.
- Contents: Prototype algorithms, simulation models, and testing frameworks.
